2D top-down adventure escape game I made in 48 hours for a game jam.

Frozen in Time is a 2D top-down adventure escape game built around a single core idea: manipulating time by rewinding the past.
In a frozen forest where time no longer flows correctly, the player discovers a mysterious clock that allows them to rewind objects and enemies. Using this power, players must overcome environmental obstacles, survive enemy encounters, and solve puzzles by understanding when and how to rewind time.

Time is not a weapon in this world — it is a tool. Rewinding at the wrong moment changes nothing, but using it wisely opens new paths forward.

🧩 Story
After finding an ancient clock deep in the forest, the protagonist realizes that time itself is broken. With guidance from mysterious NPCs, the player learns that the only way to restore balance is to rewind the past and rebuild what was lost — in the correct order.
